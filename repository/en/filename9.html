I’ll stick around to answer your questions about the report (and other topics) in the comments. Hi all, It’s that time of year again when we share Reddit’s annual transparency report. We share this report each year because you have a right to know how user data is being managed by Reddit, and how it’s both shared and not shared with government and non-government parties. You’ll find information on content removed from Reddit and requests for user information. This year, we’ve expanded the report to include new data—specifically, a breakdown of content policy removals, content manipulation removals, subreddit removals, and subreddit quarantines. By the numbers Since the full report is rather long, I’ll call out a few stats below: ADMIN REMOVALS In 2019, we removed ~53M pieces of content in total, mostly for spam and content manipulation (e.g. brigading and vote cheating), exclusive of legal/copyright removals, which we track separately. For Content Policy violations, we removed 222k pieces of content, 55.9k accounts, and 21.2k 9.9k comments sharesave 75.9k Crossposted by2 months ago Comments are locked 2& 14 More Suspected Campaign from Russia on Reddit reddit.com/r/redd... • Posted by2 months ago Comments are locked 52913 Suspected Campaign from Russia on Reddit We were recently made aware of a post on Reddit that included leaked documents from the UK. We investigated this account and the accounts connected to it, and today we believe this was part of a campaign that has been reported as originating from Russia. Earlier this year Facebook discovered a Russian campaign on its platform, which was further analyzed by the Atlantic Council and dubbed “Secondary Infektion.” Suspect accounts on Reddit were recently reported to us, along with indicators from law enforcement, and we were able to confirm that they did indeed show a pattern of coordination. We were then able to use these accounts to identify additional suspect accounts that were part of the campaign on Reddit. This group provides us with important attribution for the recent posting of the leaked UK documents, as well as insights into how adversaries are adapting their tactics. In late October, an account u/gregoratior posted the leaked documents and later reposted by an additional account u/ostermaxnn. Additionally, we were able to find a pocket of accounts participating in vote manipulation on the original post. All of these accounts have the same shared pattern as the original Secondary Infektion group detected, causing us to believe that this was indeed tied to the original group. Outside of the post by u/gregoratior, none of these accounts or posts received much attention on the platform, and many of the posts were removed either by moderators or as part of normal content manipulation operations. The accounts posted in different regional subreddits, and in several different languages. Karma distribution: 0 or less: 42 1 - 9: 13 10 or greater: 6 Max Karma: 48 As a result of this investigation, we are banning 1 subreddit and 61 accounts under our policies against vote manipulation and misuse of the platform. As we have done with previous influence operations, we will also preserve these accounts for a time, so that researchers and the public can scrutinize them to see for themselves how these accounts operated.

Today we are sharing our first Reddit Security Report, which we'll be continuing on a quarterly basis. We are committed to continuously evolving how we tackle these problems. The purpose of these reports is to keep you informed about relevant events and actions. By The Numbers Category Volume (July - Sept) Volume (April - June) Content manipulation reports 5,461,005 5,222,058 Admin content manipulation removals 19,149,133 14,375,903 Admin content manipulation account sanctions 1,406,440 2,520,474 3rd party breach accounts processed 4,681,297,045 1,355,654,815 Protective account security actions 7,190,318 1,845,605 These are the primary metrics we track internally, and we thought you’d want to see them too. If there are alternative metrics that seem worth looking at as part of this report, we’re all ears. Content Manipulation Content manipulation is a term we use to combine things like spam, community interference, vote manipulation, etc. This year we have overhauled how we handle these issues, and this quarter was no different.

Hey everyone, We wanted to let you know about some changes that we are making today to our Content Policy regarding content that threatens, harasses, or bullies, which you can read in full here. Why are we doing this? These changes, which were many months in the making, were primarily driven by feedback we received from you all, our users, indicating to us that there was a problem with the narrowness of our previous policy. Specifically, the old policy required a behavior to be “continued” and/or “systematic” for us to be able to take action against it as harassment. It also set a high bar of users fearing for their real-world safety to qualify, which we think is an incorrect calibration. Finally, it wasn’t clear that abuse toward both individuals and groups qualified under the rule. All these things meant that too often, instances of harassment and bullying, even egregious ones, were left unactioned. This was a bad user experience for you all, and frankly, it is something that made us feel not-great too. It was clearly a case of the letter of a rule not matching its spirit. The changes we’re making today are trying to better address that, as well as to give some meta-context about the spirit of this rule: chiefly, Reddit is a place for conversation. Thus, behavior whose core effect is to shut people out of that conversation through intimidation or abuse has no place on our platform. We also hope that this change will take some of the burden off moderators, as it will expand our ability to take action at scale against content that the vast majority of subreddits already have their own rules against-- rules that we support and encourage. How will these changes work in practice? We all know that context is critically important here, and can be tricky, particularly when we’re talking about typed words on the internet. This is why we’re hoping today’s changes will help us better leverage human user reports. Where previously, we required the harassment victim to make the report to us directly, we’ll now be investigating reports from bystanders as well. We hope this will alleviate some of the burden on the harassee. You should also know that we’ll also be harnessing some improved machine-learning tools to help us better sort and prioritize human user reports. But don’t worry, machines will only help us organize and prioritize user reports. They won’t be banning content or users on their own. A human user still has to report the content in order to surface it to us. Likewise, all actual decisions will still be made by a human admin. As with any rule change, this will take some time to fully enforce. Our response times have improved significantly since the start of the year, but we’re always striving to move faster. In the meantime, we encourage moderators to take this opportunity to examine their community rules and make sure that they are not creating an environment where bullying or harassment are tolerated or encouraged. 17.3k 10.4k comments sharesave 10.9k Crossposted by5 months ago Comments are locked An Update on Content Manipulation… And an Upcoming Report old.reddit.com/r/redd... • Posted by5 months ago An Update on Content Manipulation… And an Upcoming Report TL;DR: Bad actors never sleep, and we are always evolving how we identify and mitigate them. But with the upcoming election, we know you want to see more. So we're committing to a quarterly report on content manipulation and account security, with the first to be shared in October. But first, we want to share context today on the history of content manipulation efforts and how we've evolved over the years to keep the site authentic. A brief history The concern of content manipulation on Reddit is as old as Reddit itself. Before there were subreddits (circa 2005), everyone saw the same content and we were primarily concerned with spam and vote manipulation. As we grew in scale and introduced subreddits, we had to become more sophisticated in our detection and mitigation of these issues. The creation of subreddits also created new threats, with “brigading” becoming a more common occurrence (even if rarely defined). Today, we are not only dealing with growth hackers, bots, and your typical shitheadery, but we have to worry about more advanced threats, such as state actors interested in interfering with elections and inflaming social divisions. This represents an evolution in content manipulation, not only on Reddit, but across the internet. These advanced adversaries have resources far larger than a typical spammer. However, as with early days at Reddit, we are committed to combating this threat, while better empowering users and moderators to minimize exposure to inauthentic or manipulated content. What we’ve done Our strategy has been to focus on fundamentals and double down on things that have protected our platform in the past (including the 2016 election). Influence campaigns represent an evolution in content manipulation, not something fundamentally new. This means that these campaigns are built on top of some of the same tactics as historical manipulators (certainly with their own flavor). Namely, compromised accounts, vote manipulation, and inauthentic community engagement. This is why we have hardened our protections against these types of issues on the site. Compromised accounts This year alone, we have taken preventative actions on over 10.6M accounts with compromised login credentials (check yo’ self), or accounts that have been hit by bots attempting to breach them. This is important because compromised accounts can be used to gain immediate credibility on the site, and to quickly scale up a content attack on the site (yes, even that throwaway account with password = Password! is a potential threat!). Vote Manipulation The purpose of our anti-cheating rules is to make it difficult for a person to unduly impact the votes on a particular piece of content. These rules, along with user downvotes (because you know bad content when you see it), are some of the most powerful protections we have to ensure that misinformation and low quality content doesn’t get much traction on Reddit. We have strengthened these protections (in ways we can’t fully share without giving away the secret sauce). As a result, we have reduced the visibility of vote manipulated content by 20% over the last 12 months.

We’re back with a new experience for the community, the Reddit Public Access Network (RPAN). Starting August 19 until 5PM PT, and from 9AM-5PM PT through Friday, August 23, redditors around the world will be able to create live broadcasts. In true Reddit fashion, voting will determine the top broadcast, and you can explore different broadcasts by swiping or clicking right or left. As you move further from the top broadcast, the broadcasts you see will be increasingly more random, so we encourage you to explore and vote! First and foremost, this is about having fun as a Reddit community, and if you all enjoy it, we’ll continue to explore how it might work as an actual feature. So if you have thoughts, suggestions, or other feedback, please share that in the comments of this post. We genuinely want to hear what you all think, and we look through all of the comments we can, including those without many upvotes. We’re rolling out the RPAN experience progressively across Reddit starting August 19, so it’s possible that some people may see RPAN earlier than others. Some general rules for broadcasting with RPAN: RPAN is a Safe for Work experience—Nudity, sexually suggestive content, graphic violence, illegal/dangerous behavior, hoax promotion, or content that would be seen as highly offensive/upsetting to the average redditor will result in a banned account All redditors may see your stream, so don’t show yourself if you want to stay anonymous Be like the Lambeosaurus—feed on pine needles and have a good time Read the full rules here. 6.7k points 1.0k comments 7.8k 1.2k comments sharesave 13.9k Posted by7 months ago Archived 5223& 6 More Introducing Community Awards!

Community Awards give mods the ability to create custom Awards for redditors to use in their own communities. Mods can select the images, names, and Coin price of Awards to reflect their own communities. Awards can be priced between 500 Coins and 40,000 Coins. Community Awards will be available to give in the communities that created them, in addition to Silver, Gold, and Platinum Awards (which are available site-wide).A highly decorated post on r/DunderMifflin, featuring Silver, Gold, and Platinum, as well as the new Community Awards!
