I am taking my first LSAT on March 30th and have been practicing for about 2 months now. I'm averaging -10 on LR and LG with most of the wrong questions bunched from 14-20 on any given timed section. When I do it un-timed I'm at about -3 per section. Target score is about 161-165 and just wanted some thoughts on how to reduce the time stress in the middle or if a score like that is even attainable with where I am currently. • comment sharesave • •Posted byjust now Join further evidence towards howard=wake theory spoiler • comment sharesave • •Posted byjust now Join Trying to find this tank from Rael’s Instagram.

Thoughts? For context, I’m also a teacher. Some background: My sister (J) is a junior in high school living in a different state than I do. J is on the speech and debate team at school. She’s actually really good. That said, I’ve heard a handful of stories from J and my mom that the coach (C) is a little odd. J has mentioned on numerous occasions that students have a nickname for C and all around do not care for her. The facts: My mom has said the she and other parents are irritated that C is very obvious about which team members she favors over others. The “favorite” students are chosen to travel to compete, despite not earning good rankings at home tournaments. This woman has also apparently been very open with students about her personal life. She’s made comments regarding her unhappiness in her marriage and has talked about previous relationships on several occasions. J noted that these comments and conversations make her uncomfortable. At tournaments, C has apparently facilitated a Truth or Dare tradition where she has students gather in her hotel room to bond. J told me that C participates alongside students. On one such occurrence, J reported that a student asked about when C lost her virginity and C gave details about her first time. C has made some poor decisions when responsible for students. When students were out of state for a tournament and C allegedly drove at a speed of 105 mph on the highway with 5-6 students in the vehicle. A student took a video of the speedometer. Upon return from the aforementioned tournament, C created a new syllabus and had students parents and sign. In the new syllabus, it says that any complaints will result in students being kicked off of the travel team. Now this: My mom texts me a picture today showing me a note given to J by C as part of a Valentine. The Valentine in and of itself seems like an odd touch, but the note says: *J’s nickname, My mother always I’d have a daughter like me. It’s probably too soon to tell, but if I had a student who was just like me as a teen, I expect it would be you. Sassy, smart, sarcastic. And awesome. Thanks for being you. [drawn heart] Mrs. C* Apparently no other students received a note like this. Any thoughts? My mom thinks C is grooming J. As a teacher myself, I think she’s definitely crossing boundaries, but I’m not sure what can be done.

Preferably the EU market. For instance if I want to work extra as a sales representative for a product thats offered in another EU country but not in my country, how do I find manufacturers that want to expand their sales but dont want to start sales offices themselfs. There must be tons of suppliers and new tech ive never heard of. Found some other sectors all refers to Alibaba and alike but thats just some a whole different market.

Unanswered I put together a few examples: https://imgur.com/a/aJjM3WC Basically, they all start with a picture of a pretty girl with really nice nails or makeup or whatever, and then they go on to list "facts" which are usually untrue, "self-care tips" which are usually bad, and bits of advice/inspiration which are probably not a good idea to follow. They're kinda targeted toward my demographic - girls between the ages of 13-18 I'm guessing. Most girls I've talked to, however, think that these posts are stupid and weird. So I have no idea why they're even successful. The most baffling part to me is the pictures. Almost every single thread I've seen has started with a very dewy photo of a pretty girl, often coupled with an unrelated "aesthetic" pic. I really don't get it. Anyone know what this is all about? • 1 comment sharesave View all SportsNewsGamingAww Reddit Premium Reddit Premium The best Reddit experience, with monthly CoinsTry Now Trending Communities r/lotrmemes 560k members Join r/vegansnacks 26.1k members Join r/deepseacreatures 47.2k members Join r/Animalsthatlovemagic 140k members Join r/photoshopbattles 15.8m members Join Popular Communities See more Gaming See more Sports See more TV See more Travel See more Health & Fitness See more Fashion See more helpReddit AppReddit coinsReddit premiumReddit giftsCommunitiesTop PostsTopics aboutcareerspressadvertiseblogTermsContent policyPrivacy policyMod policy Reddit Inc © 2020.

SportsCenter, Bleacher Report, and ESPN have tweeted about Shai a total of 4 times this season. Those same accounts have combined for 43 Caruso posts. So full disclaimer, I'm not taking credit for these numbers. Source to the original tweet that received a lot of traction on twitter here: https://twitter.com/joeylinn_/status/1233503413398274048 Caruso is obviously a solid role player for the Lakers so stuff like this isn't really against his basketball play, but national media basically sort of 'meme'-fying him and using any excuse to post about him just bcuz he looks different, sort of disrespectful and in a way obnoxiously derogatory to Caruso himself? And obviously Shai is just one example of so many countless promising players in the NBA that hardly receive any coverage despite their stellar play, but it does beg the question, if a 21 year rising star and leading scorer on one of the top teams in the NBA can hardly get any coverage from national media, then what are we even doing here. • 135 comments sharesave • •Posted by1 hour ago More than 10K turn out for Bernie Sanders rally in Elizabeth Warren's backyard usatoday.com/story/...

If your parents have decent credit and take care of their shit, see if they’ll make you an AU on a card and then lock the card up in a box. Being AU makes the credit history of the account show up on your credit report. If financial responsibility is a big deal in your house, this can have some major advantages when you’re trying to get started. level 2 1.7k points · 2 hours ago This is seriously one of the best things that ever happened to me, financially speaking. My parents were kind and thoughtful enough to make me an AU on their account, and because of that good credit score, and my good job, I was able to secure a home loan last year at the age of 23. (Keep in mind though that I have no student loans or other major debts) I fully acknowledge that this situation is a privileged one, not everybody has parents with a good credit score and/or are willing to make you an AU, but it's absolutely something I'd recommend to anyone who has this opportunity.

The person who died was a man in his 50s who had underlying health conditions, and there was no evidence he contracted the virus through travel, health officials said. Shortly after announcement of the death, President Donald Trump at a White House press conference said the United States is issuing more travel restrictions and warnings to help prevent spread of the virus. He also said he is meeting with pharmaceutical executives to discuss work toward a coronavirus vaccine. 'This is what we expected': Azar discusses risk of coronavirus in the U.S.Feb. 29, 202001:42 Washington Gov. Jay Inslee meanwhile declared a state of emergency in response to new cases of COVID-19, directing state agencies to use all resources necessary to prepare for and respond to the outbreak. “This will allow us to get the resources we need,” Inslee said. “This is a time to take commonsense, proactive measures to ensure the health and safety of those who live in Washington state."

The news and stories that matters, delivered weekday mornings. Sign Up This site is protected by recaptcha Privacy Policy | Terms of Service The outbreak in the U.S. is currently limited to only some communities, the CDC said Saturday. “There is not national spread of COVID-19. CDC and the federal government are working to keep it that way,” said Dr. Nancy Messonnier, director of the Center for the National Center for Immunization and Respiratory Diseases. Health officials said that the man who died was among three new presumptive cases in Washington state, which are cases that test positive locally but with CDC confirmation pending. He was a patient at a local hospital, and officials are investigating how he contracted the virus. The other two new presumptive cases in Washington state are both patients at a long-term care facility. One is a woman in her 40s in satisfactory condition, the other a person in their 70s in serious condition. As of early Saturday, the United States had about 66 cases of coronavirus, including nine people who have recovered and four presumptive cases. The patient who died was among new cases reported Friday in Washington state as well as Oregon and California. Among the new confirmed or presumptive cases, there were three contracted from an unknown source, bringing the total number of what could be "community spread" cases in the United States to four. "Community spread" is a term used when someone is infected but the source is unknown. Previously much of the focus was on people who had visited places such as Wuhan, China, where the outbreak began, or who had been in close contact with people who were infected. The patients from these four cases have no known travel history or exposure to someone who had traveled or been infected. Not all four have been confirmed by Centers for Disease Control and Prevention testing, but they tested positive locally. The CDC adjusted its testing guidance this week to include people with symptoms but with no identified source of exposure. The first case of COVID-19 in the United States which may involve community spread was confirmed by a CDC test on Wednesday. That patient is at UC Davis Medical Center in Sacramento, California, and involves a woman from Solano County, officials said. President Donald Trump said at the press conference Saturday that "there's no reason to panic" and the American public does not need to change their daily routines. He said he will meet with pharmaceutical companies on Monday to talk about a vaccine. "They've already started working on it," he said. "These companies will be coming to the White House." Inslee said, "It is a sad day in our state as we learn that a Washingtonian has died from COVID-19. Our hearts go out to his family and friends. We will continue to work toward a day where no one dies from this virus.” This is a developing story.

The US and Nato allies have agreed to withdraw all troops within 14 months if the militants uphold the deal. President Trump said it had been a "long and hard journey" in Afghanistan. "It's time after all these years to bring our people back home," he said. Talks between the Afghan government and the Taliban are due to follow. Under the agreement, the militants also agreed not to allow al-Qaeda or any other extremist group to operate in the areas they control. The long road to peace The Afghan war: The short and long story What could peace look like? Who are the Taliban? Speaking at the White House, Mr Trump said the Taliban had been trying to reach an agreement with the US for a long time. He said US troops had been killing terrorists in Afghanistan "by the thousands" and now it was "time for someone else to do that work and it will be the Taliban and it could be surrounding countries". "I really believe the Taliban wants to do something to show we're not all wasting time," Mr Trump added. "If bad things happen, we'll go back with a force like no-one's ever seen." Media playback is unsupported on your device Media captionThe United States and the Taliban mark the signing of their agreement in Doha. The US invaded Afghanistan weeks after the September 2001 attacks in New York by the Afghanistan-based al-Qaeda group. More than 2,400 US troops have been killed during the conflict. About 12,000 are still stationed in the country. President Trump has promised to put an end to the conflict. What happened in Doha? The deal was signed by US special envoy Zalmay Khalilzad and Taliban political chief Mullah Abdul Ghani Baradar with US Secretary of State Mike Pompeo as a witness. In a speech, Mr Pompeo urged the militant group to "keep your promises to cut ties with al-Qaeda". Mr Baradar said he hoped Afghanistan could now emerge from four decades of conflict. "I hope that with the withdrawal of all foreign forces from Afghanistan the Afghan nation under an Islamic regime will take its relief and embark on a new prosperous life," he said. Image copyright AFP Image caption Afghans in Jalalabad celebrated ahead of the deal's signing Meanwhile US Defence Secretary Mark Esper was in the Afghan capital Kabul alongside Afghanistan's President Ashraf Ghani - whose government did not take part in the US-Taliban talks. Mr Esper said: "This is a hopeful moment, but it is only the beginning. The road ahead will not be easy. Achieving lasting peace in Afghanistan will require patience and compromise among all parties." He said the US would continue to support the Afghan government. Mr Ghani said the country was "looking forward to a full ceasefire". The government said it was ready to negotiate with the Taliban. What's in the agreement? Within the first 135 days of the deal the US will reduce its forces in Afghanistan to 8,600, with allies also drawing down their forces proportionately. The move would allow US President Donald Trump to show that he has brought troops home ahead of the US presidential election in November. The deal also provides for a prisoner swap. Some 5,000 Taliban prisoners and 1,000 Afghan security force prisoners would be exchanged by 10 March, when talks between the Taliban and the Afghan government are due to start. The US will also lift sanctions against the Taliban and work with the UN to lift its separate sanctions against the group. In Kabul, activist Zahra Husseini said she feared the deal could worsen the situation for women in Afghanistan. "I don't trust the Taliban, and remember how they suppressed women when they were ruling," the 28-year-old told AFP. "Today is a dark day, and as I was watching the deal being signed, I had this bad feeling that it would result in their return to power rather than in peace." Landmark deal rife with uncertainties This historic deal has been years in the making, as all sides kept seeking advantage on the battlefield. The agreement is born of America's determination to bring troops home and a recognition, at least by some Taliban, that talks are the best route to return to Kabul. It's a significant step forward, despite deep uncertainty and scepticism over where it will lead. When the only alternative is unending war, many Afghans seem ready to take this risk for peace. Taliban leaders say they've changed since their harsh rule of the 1990s still seared in the memory of many, and most of all Afghan women. This process will test the Taliban, but also veteran Afghan leaders of the past, and a new generation which has come of age in the last two decades and is hoping against hope for a different future. What reaction has there been? UN Secretary-General Antonio Guterres stressed "the importance of sustaining the nationwide reduction in violence, for the benefit of all Afghans" Nato Secretary-General Jens Stoltenberg: "We went in together in 2001, we are going to adjust [troop levels] together and when the time is right, we are going to leave together, but we are only going to leave when conditions are right" UK Defence Secretary Ben Wallace: "I welcome this small but important step towards the chance for Afghans to live in peace, free from terrorism... We remain absolutely committed to building an Afghanistan that is a strong partner for decades to come" How did US-Taliban talks come about? Since 2011, Qatar has hosted Taliban leaders who have moved there to discuss peace in Afghanistan. It has been a chequered process. A Taliban office was opened in 2013, and closed the same year amid rows over flags. Other attempts at talks stalled. In December 2018, the militants announced they would meet US officials to try to find a "roadmap to peace". But the hard-line Islamist group continued to refuse to hold official talks with the Afghan government, whom they dismissed as American "puppets". Media playback is unsupported on your device Media captionThe view from Lashkar Gah province on whether peace with the Taliban is possible Following nine rounds of US-Taliban talks in Qatar, the two sides seemed close to an agreement. Washington's top negotiator announced last September that the US would withdraw 5,400 troops from Afghanistan within 20 weeks as part of a deal agreed "in principle" with Taliban militants. Days later, Mr Trump said the talks were "dead", after the group killed a US soldier. But within weeks the two sides resumed discussions behind the scenes. A week ago the Taliban agreed to a "reduction of violence" - although Afghan officials say at least 22 soldiers and 14 civilians have been killed in Taliban attacks over that period.

The Afghan women determined not to lose out What's the background to the Afghan war? It began when the US launched air strikes one month following the 11 September 2001 attacks and after the Taliban had refused to hand over the man behind them, Osama bin Laden. Media playback is unsupported on your device Media captionTens of thousands of Afghan soldiers have been killed and injured. This is their story The US was joined by an international coalition and the Taliban were quickly removed from power. However, they turned into an insurgent force and continued deadly attacks, destabilising subsequent Afghan governments. The international coalition ended its combat mission in 2014, staying only to train Afghan forces. But the US continued its own, scaled-back combat operation, including air strikes. The Taliban has however continued to gain momentum and in 2018 the BBC found they were active across 70% of Afghanistan. Media playback is unsupported on your device Media captionZan TV presenter Ogai Wardak: "If the Taliban come, I will fight them" Nearly 3,500 members of the international coalition forces have died in Afghanistan since the 2001 invasion. The figures for Afghan civilians, militants and government forces are more difficult to quantify. In a February 2019 report, the UN said that more than 32,000 civilians had died. The Watson Institute at Brown University says 58,000 security personnel and 42,000 opposition combatants have been killed. Why has the war lasted so long? There are many reasons for this. But they include a combination of fierce Taliban resistance, the limitations of Afghan forces and governance, and other countries' reluctance to keep their troops for longer in Afghanistan. At times over the past 18 years, the Taliban have been on the back foot. In late 2009, US President Barack Obama announced a troop "surge" that saw the number of American soldiers in Afghanistan top 100,000. Media playback is unsupported on your device Media captionThe BBC was given exclusive access to spend a week with ambulance workers in Afghanistan. The surge helped drive the Taliban out of parts of southern Afghanistan, but it was never destined to last for years. The BBC World Service's Dawood Azami says there are five main reasons the war is still going on now. They include: a lack of political clarity since the invasion began, and questions about the effectiveness of the US strategy over the past 18 years the fact each side is trying to break what has become a stalemate - and that the Taliban have been trying maximise their leverage during peace negotiations an increase in violence by Islamic State militants in Afghanistan - they've been behind some of the bloodiest attacks recently There's also the role played by Afghanistan's neighbour, Pakistan. There's no question the Taliban have their roots in Pakistan, and that they were able to regroup there during the US invasion. But Pakistan has denied helping or protecting them - even as the US demanded it do more to fight militants.

Stevens Wage growth slows under Trump Igor Derysh Trump's disinformation juggernaut Lucian K. Truscott IV Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-KY) (Getty/Tom Brenner) Superdelegate pushing convention effort to stop Sanders is health care lobbyist who backed McConnell William Owen gave $8,500 to the Senators Classic Committee, a joint fundraising committee backing Mitch McConnell -- Shares Igor Derysh February 29, 2020 10:00AM (UTC) Correction: An earlier version of this story incorrectly listed William Owen as a current executive member of the Tennessee Democratic Party. A Democratic superdelegate promoting an effort to stop Sen. Bernie Sanders, I-Vt., if he fails to clinch a majority of pledged delegates is a health care lobbyist who has contributed thousands to Republicans. William Owen, a former Tennessee lawmaker and Democratic National Committee member, was among the superdelegates quoted in a New York Times article revealing an effort among party insiders to block Sanders' path to the nomination if he wins a plurality of pledged delegates but not enough to secure a win on a first ballot. Advertisement: Owen also owns the lobbying firm Asset & Equity Corporations and donated $8,500 to the Senators Classic Committee, a joint fundraising committee backing Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell, R-Ky., and more than a dozen other Republicans like Sen. Lindsey Graham, R-S.C., last year, according to Federal Election Commission filings first flagged by The Intercept. He has also donated to Sen. Mike Rounds, R-S.D., and Sen. Dan Sullivan, R-Alaska, according to the report. Owen told The Intercept that he also contributes to Democrats, but the outlet found no record that he donated to any congressional or presidential Democratic candidates this cycle despite backing Democrats in the past. "I am a committed Democrat, but as a lobbyist, there are times when I need to have access to both sides. And the way to get access quite often is to make campaign contributions," he told the outlet. "I'm a registered lobbyist, and I represent clients. And they have interest in front of Congress, and I attend the Senator's Classic, which is a Republican event, each year." Advertisement: Owen is a registered lobbyist for the health care technology firm Klox Technologies. He endorsed former Vice President Joe Biden. Politico reported last fall that Owen pushed Biden's team to "develop a second-ballot strategy" for the Democratic National Convention. Owen warned that if Sanders or fellow progressive Sen. Elizabeth Warren, D-Mass, "surges" then "we're in trouble." With Sanders surging across the country after winning the popular vote in each of the Democratic Party's first three nominating contests, Owen told The Times he hopes former President Barack Obama intervenes to broker a deal, or if he was unwilling, that former first lady Michelle Obama could be nominated as vice president. Advertisement: "She's the only person I can think of who can unify the party and help us win," he said. "This election is about saving the American experiment as a republic. It's also about saving the world. This is not an ordinary election." Numerous other Democrats told The Times they planned to try to block Sanders if he did not win a majority, even though the same article quoted President Obama warning that the Democratic Party "shouldn't engage in smoke-filled-room politics" because "those kinds of deals would have prevented him from capturing the nomination when he ran against Hillary Clinton." Advertisement: Owen previously tried to block the Sanders-backed effort to reduce the role superdelegates play at the convention. "If we don't have a vote, then what good are we?" he complained to Politico in 2018. But the DNC conceded to Sanders supporters and barred superdelegates from voting on the first ballot. If no candidate wins a majority of delegates, the convention would go to a second ballot for the first time since 1952, allowing the party's 771 superdelegates to potentially swing the nomination to their preferred candidate. The Intercept previously identified a number of superdelegates who work with health care clients that oppose Sanders' Medicare for All plan and large banks like Goldman Sachs and JP Morgan Chase. A growing number of superdelegates have also gone to work for presidential campaigns opposing Sanders. Advertisement: Election forecaster FiveThirtyEight predicts that Sanders has a 29% chance to win a majority of delegates, but there is a greater chance (52%) that no candidate does. Every candidate except Sanders vowed to let the convention "work its will" at the Nevada debate earlier this month. Bloomberg has already quietly started making moves to shore up support from superdelegates, as well as supporters of moderates like Biden and former South Bend Mayor Pete Buttigieg, Politico reported last week. Bloomberg has also hired the vice-chairs of the California and Texas Democratic parties, who are both superdelegates, in an effort to "purchase political support," the watchdog group Campaign Legal Center's Brendan Fisher told The Intercept. "This does seem to fit a longstanding pattern of Bloomberg using his billions to help generate support among political elites," he told the outlet. Advertisement: Some Democrats worry that Sanders is a risky candidate in spite of a consistent trend of polls showing that he could actually be the most electable candidate. Democrats who emerged from previous intraparty fights at conventions over the last 70 years went on to lose more than 40 states to Republicans each time. "We shouldn't be second-guessing voters," Nebraska Democratic Chairwoman Jane Kleeb told The Times. "If that's what our party leaders are going to do, you'll see rebellion not just in the presidential race but in down-ballot races, as well." Yasmine Taeb, a DNC member from Virginia, argued that Bloomberg poses a much bigger risk than Sanders despite his self-declared claim to electability. "Why shouldn't D.N.C. members — especially the ones of us who were elected by the grass roots — instead be concerned about a former Republican sexist billionaire who is trying to buy the election? I certainly am," she told The Times. "I'm not concerned, however, with the progressive candidate with the largest grass-roots support across the country to win the nomination, because that's precisely what is needed to defeat Donald Trump."

Invincible would have been amazing, dunno why people are saying it wouldn't. On to the next one, huge fucking sigh tho. level 2 6 points · 1 hour ago I get the frustration, but losing was almost an inevitability. The margins are just so close. Liverpool just had the perfect storm of checking off defensively, a poor effort going forward, and Watford playing hungry. Nothing more than that. They’re still leaps and bounds better than everyone else this year. Klopp will use this loss well. level 1 9 points · 2 hours ago Full credit to Watford. Tbf I never thought we can beat Arsenal's record in the first place. It looked likely but I didn't really believe it. Anyway the lads shouldn't focus on records but on winning the title. Today's loss shall serve 'em well and hopefully will be a wake up call cause my god we were dog shit last few games. level 1 4 points · 2 hours ago lol level 1 3 points · 2 hours ago “It’s easy, yeah not that hard” - Ben fucking Foster level 1 2 points · 2 hours ago I know it’s disheartening but if our goal is to simply win the league then I’d rather just win it without added pressure to be invincible 100 times over level 1 4 points · 2 hours ago my disappointment is immeasurable and my day is ruined :( .Watford played well and deserved it. Have a nice evening people :) level 1 11 points · 2 hours ago Liverpool had some shaky and vulnerable performance and lucky last few minute goals this season, but not today.

I believe city need to lose their next 2 now. Feel free to correct me if Im wrong Edit: Seems like I'm wrong according to some of the comments I'm reading level 1 9 points · 2 hours ago When you see this result and this Liverpool team, it really makes Arsenals invincible season all the more incredible. To go 38 games unbeaten against the best 19 teams in England is something I can't ever see being repeated, and this is a Liverpool who are one of the best teams I've seen in my 20 years of watching football level 1 3 points · 2 hours ago Deeney with the boss "ahh, that'll do" at the very end lmfao level 1 2 points · 2 hours ago Nice level 1 Viridez-22 points · 2 hours ago(More than 3 children) level 2 -1 points · 2 hours ago we needed to lose. we’ve been getting too complacent recently level 2 22 points · 2 hours ago “Never cared about running unbeaten” lol.

Recently he's been hitting the gym really consistently and trying to up his calorie intake/protien intake etc. My question is how do I encourage him without making him feel like he's unattractive to me in his natural body? I have said things like "your shoulders feel thicker, so sexy!" after sex or a hug. But I don't want him to think I'm only attracted to him if he's muscular, but it is true the beefier he gets, the sexier he gets! I just don't want to do any unintended psychological damage in the process. 5.5k 393 comments sharesave 33 Posted by5 hours ago What are some relationship advice you’d give to men who just started their dating life? 33 60 comments sharesave • Posted by1 hour ago How do you deal with that embarrassing ex-girlfriend? In my case, I (27m) dated this girl for about four years. During the relationship I learned of her psychological issues that she was medicated for. Despite this, she displayed normal behavior for the most of the relationship other than minor recreational drug use (marijuana,occasionally adderall). Towards the end her drug use was getting out of hand and it led to our break up. She was spending all her time and resources looking for drugs. This is where the problem begins. Normally one could simply cut ties with the addict and be done with them but she would often contact my friends and people I know looking for/trying to sell drugs. This continued long after we broke up. This has been embarrassing for me because many people in our small town still associated us together. Since then I’ve often had people tell about the promiscuous and addict like behavior she is now known for. Now, I know I have no control over her actions and I’m sure others realize that as well but I can’t help but feel embarrassed every time I hear about her actions. I feel like it has affected my own reputation and people see me as a fool for dating someone like that. Also I know she has made many false claims and accusations about me to others in the community so I can only imagine what she’s said that i don’t yet know about. I just wish I was never associated with her. I would just like to hear from other men who have dealt with similar situations and how you guys have learned to handle this. These days I still cringe when reminded of this and it gives me feelings of embarrassment and anxiety. • 6 comments sharesave 88 Posted by14 hours ago What’s the one celebrity you would love to share a beer with? 88 210 comments sharesave 10 Posted by3 hours ago Men who have been in psychologically abusive relationships, when did you realize what was happening?

Coins Press J to jump to the feed. Press question mark to learn the rest of the keyboard shortcuts log insign up User account menu Coins are a virtual good you can use to award exemplary posts or comments. Support Reddit and encourage your favorite contributors to keep making Reddit better.Get coins Here’s what you can buy with Coins Spend your Coins on these Awards reserved exclusively for the finest Reddit contributors. Awarding a post or comment highlights it for all to see, and some Awards also grant the honoree special bonuses. Silver Award Shows a Silver Award on the post or comment and ... that’s it. You’ll need 100 Coins. Gold Award Gives the recipient a week of Reddit Premium (including 100 Coins) and shows a Gold Award on the post or comment. You’ll need 500 Coins. Platinum Award Gives the recipient a month of Reddit Premium, which includes 700 Coins for that month, and shows a Platinum Award on the post or comment. You’ll need 1800 Coins. Get 700 Coins every month with Reddit Premium and browse ads-free$5.99/Month Coins FAQ What are Coins? Coins are our virtual good, and you can use them to award exceptional posts or comments, giving them Silver, Gold, or Platinum. We'll be adding cool new ways to spend your Coins in the future. What is "Give Award"? Giving an Award, or "gilding", is a way to show appreciation for an exceptional contribution to Reddit. You can award someone by clicking on "Give Award" below their post or comment. This distinguishes it with an Award for all to see, and some even grant the honoree special bonus benefits. What are these new Award types? There are now several ways to Give Awards. A Silver Award requires 100 Coins, which simply marks a post or comment with a Silver Award icon. A classic Gold Award requires 500 Coins and gives the recipient a week of Reddit Premium membership and 100 Coins. Finally, the ultra rare Platinum Award costs 1800 Coins, and gives the recipient with one month of Reddit Premium membership, which includes 700 Coins for that month. I bought Coins, how can I tell how many I have? If you buy Coins you will always have a balance associated with your Reddit account. You can view your balance on the top navigation bar by your username. Can I transfer Coins between Reddit accounts? You cannot transfer your Reddit Coin balance across usernames, sorry. You can offer a Gold Award to other users which will grant them 100 Coins. Can I get Coins for free? We may give away Coins on special occasions. Stay tuned! What happened to Creddits? Do those still exist? Yes, Creddits are simply called "Coins" now, and we've converted any existing balance at a generous exchange rate of one Creddit to 2000 Coins. That's double their original monetary value as a thank you for supporting us early. Use them to award exceptional posts and comments you come across. Thanks again for your contribution to the Reddit community. I thought Gold was the name of Reddit's subscription membership? You're correct, it used to also be the name of the subscription membership. However, many people confused the subscription "Reddit Gold" membership with a virtual good or coin. To make things easier to understand, we've renamed the membership to "Reddit Premium", while our virtual good is called "Coins". about careers press advertise blog help the reddit app reddit coins reddit premium reddit gifts Facebook Twitter Instagram content policy privacy policy user agreement mod policy © 2020 Reddit, Inc.

What happened to calling it Gold? The membership has a new name for a good reason. Many people confused the subscription Reddit Gold membership with a virtual good or coin. To make things easier to understand, we’ve renamed the membership to “Reddit Premium”, while the virtual good is called “Coins”. We have kept your favorite features and added more. What if I was subscribed to the old Gold Membership program? Fine people everywhere with a Gold Membership are now members of Reddit Premium. It still offers the same great ads-free browsing experience and access to r/lounge, but now you will also receive 700 Coins monthly so you can award exceptional contributions.

Raised in northern Virginia, Huffman pursued his passion for programming from an early age and followed it through a computer science degree at the University of Virginia. In 2005, he and his college roommate Alexis Ohanian pitched their first start-up to then-new incubator Y Combinator. While the pair's initial idea for a food-ordering mobile app called My Mobile Menu was rejected, Y Combinator founder Paul Graham invited them to build a new startup, which soon led to their creation of Reddit. After selling the company in 2006, Huffman launched Hipmunk and was named to Inc. Magazine's “30 Under 30” list in 2011 and the Forbes “30 Under 30” list in 2012. A few years later, Huffman returned as CEO of Reddit, where he has led the company's development of native image and video hosting, a new mobile app, and a full site redesign while growing the Reddit community to over 330 million monthly users. In addition to his work at Reddit, Huffman is a mentor at Hackbright Academy, a San Francisco-based coding school for women. In his free time, he enjoys skiing, dancing, and browsing r/WholesomeMemes. Chris Slowe CTO Chris is CTO and Founding Engineer of Reddit.

Reddit powers hundreds of thousands of distinct online communities. This User Agreement and your conduct make that possible. Hello, redditors and people of the Internet! This Reddit User Agreement ("Terms") applies to your access to and use of the websites, mobile apps, widgets, and other online products and services (collectively, the "Services") provided by Reddit, Inc. ("Reddit," "we," or "us"). Remember Reddit is for fun and is intended to be a place for your entertainment, but we still need some basic rules. By accessing or using our Services, you agree to be bound by these Terms. If you do not agree to these Terms, you may not access or use our Services. Please take a look at Reddit’s Privacy Policy too—it explains how we collect, use, and share information about you when you access or use our Services. 1. Your Access to the Services Children under the age of 13 are not allowed to create an account or otherwise use the Services. Additionally, if you are in the European Economic Area, you must be over the age required by the laws of your country to create an account or otherwise use the Services, or we need to have received verifiable consent from your parent or legal guardian. In addition, certain of our Services or portions of our Services require you to be older than 13 years of age, so please read all notices and any Additional Terms carefully when you access the Services. If you are accepting these Terms on behalf of another legal entity, including a business or a government, you represent that you have full legal authority to bind such entity to these terms. 2. Your Use of the Services Reddit grants you a personal, non-transferable, non-exclusive, revocable, limited license to use and access the Services solely as permitted by these Terms. We reserve all rights not expressly granted to you by these Terms. Except as permitted through the Services or as otherwise permitted by us in writing, your license does not include the right to: license, sell, transfer, assign, distribute, host, or otherwise commercially exploit the Services or Content; modify, prepare derivative works of, disassemble, decompile, or reverse engineer any part of the Services or Content; or access the Services or Content in order to build a similar or competitive website, product, or service, except as permitted under the Reddit API Terms of Use. We reserve the right to modify, suspend, or discontinue the Services (in whole or in part) at any time, with or without notice to you. Any future release, update, or other addition to functionality of the Services will be subject to these Terms, which may be updated from time to time. You agree that we will not be liable to you or to any third party for any modification, suspension, or discontinuation of the Services or any part thereof. 3. Your Reddit Account and Account Security To use certain features of our Services, you may be required to create a Reddit account (an "Account") and provide us with a username, password, and certain other information about yourself as set forth in the Privacy Policy. You are solely responsible for the information associated with Your Account and anything that happens related to Your Account. You must maintain the security of your Account and promptly notify Reddit if you discover or suspect that someone has accessed your Account without your permission. We recommend that you use a strong password that is used only with the Services. You will not license, sell, or transfer your Account without our prior written approval. 4. Your Content The Services may contain information, text, links, graphics, photos, videos, or other materials (“Content”), including Content created with or submitted to the Services by you or through your Account (“Your Content”). We take no responsibility for and we do not expressly or implicitly endorse any of Your Content. By submitting Your Content to the Services, you represent and warrant that you have all rights, power, and authority necessary to grant the rights to Your Content contained within these Terms. Because you alone are responsible for Your Content, you may expose yourself to liability if you post or share Content without all necessary rights. You retain any ownership rights you have in Your Content, but you grant Reddit the following license to use that Content: When Your Content is created with or submitted to the Services, you grant us a worldwide, royalty-free, perpetual, irrevocable, non-exclusive, transferable, and sublicensable license to use, copy, modify, adapt, prepare derivative works from, distribute, perform, and display Your Content and any name, username, voice, or likeness provided in connection with Your Content in all media formats and channels now known or later developed. This license includes the right for us to make Your Content available for syndication, broadcast, distribution, or publication by other companies, organizations, or individuals who partner with Reddit. You also agree that we may remove metadata associated with Your Content, and you irrevocably waive any claims and assertions of moral rights or attribution with respect to Your Content. Any ideas, suggestions, and feedback about Reddit or our Services that you provide to us are entirely voluntary, and you agree that Reddit may use such ideas, suggestions, and feedback without compensation or obligation to you. Although we have no obligation to screen, edit, or monitor Your Content, we may, in our sole discretion, delete or remove Your Content at any time and for any reason, including for a violation of these Terms, a violation of our Content Policy, or if you otherwise create liability for us. 5. Third-Party Content, Advertisements and Promotions The Services may contain links to third-party websites, products, or services, which may be posted by advertisers, our affiliates, our partners, or other users (“Third-Party Content”). Third-Party Content is not under our control, and we are not responsible for any of their websites, products, or services. Your use of Third-Party Content is at your own risk and you should make any investigation you feel necessary before proceeding with any transaction in connection with such Third-Party Content. The Services may also contain sponsored Third-Party Content or advertisements. The type, degree, and targeting of advertisements are subject to change, and you acknowledge and agree that we may place advertisements in connection with the display of any Content or information on the Services, including Your Content. If you choose to use the Services to conduct a promotion, including a contest or sweepstakes, you alone are responsible for conducting the promotion in compliance with all applicable laws and regulations. The terms of your promotion must specifically state that the promotion is not sponsored by, endorsed by, or associated with Reddit and the rules for your promotion must require each entrant or participant to release Reddit from any liability related to the promotion. 6. Things You Cannot Do When accessing or using the Services, you must respect others and their rights, including by following these Terms and the Content Policy, so that we all may continue to use and enjoy the Services. We support the responsible reporting of security vulnerabilities. To report a security issue, please send an email to security@reddit.com. When accessing or using our Services, you will not: Create or submit Content that violates our Content Policy or attempt to circumvent any content-filtering techniques we use; Use the Services to violate applicable law or infringe any person or entity's intellectual property or any other proprietary rights; Attempt to gain unauthorized access to another user’s Account or to the Services (or to other computer systems or networks connected to or used together with the Services); Upload, transmit, or distribute to or through the Services any computer viruses, worms, or other software intended to interfere with the intended operation of a computer system or data; Use the Services to harvest, collect, gather or assemble information or data regarding the Services or users of the Services except as permitted in these Terms or in a separate agreement with Reddit; Use the Services in any manner that could interfere with, disrupt, negatively affect, or inhibit other users from fully enjoying the Services or that could damage, disable, overburden, or impair the functioning of the Services in any manner; Intentionally negate any user's actions to delete or edit their Content on the Services; or Access, query, or search the Services with any automated system, other than through our published interfaces and pursuant to their applicable terms. However, we conditionally grant permission to crawl the Services for the sole purpose of and solely to the extent necessary for creating publicly available searchable indices of the materials subject to the parameters set forth in our robots.txt file. 7. Moderators Moderating a subreddit is an unofficial, voluntary position that may be available to users of the Services. We are not responsible for actions taken by the moderators. We recognize that moderation can take some work, so we may change the features or abilities associated with moderating from time to time without prior notice. We reserve the right to revoke or limit a user’s ability to moderate at any time and for any reason or no reason, including for a breach of these Terms. If you choose to moderate a subreddit: You agree to follow the Moderator Guidelines for Healthy Communities; You agree that when you receive reports related to your community, that you will take action to moderate by removing content and/or escalating to the admins for review; You may not represent that you are authorized to act on behalf of Reddit, Inc.; You may not enter into any agreement with a third party on behalf of Reddit, or any subreddits that you moderate, without our written approval; You may not perform moderation actions in return for any form of compensation or favor from third parties; If you have access to non-public information as a result of moderating a subreddit, you will use such information only in connection with your performance as a moderator; and You may create and enforce rules for the subreddits you moderate, provided that such rules do not conflict with these Terms, our Content Policy, and the Moderator Guidelines for Healthy Communities. Reddit reserves the right, but has no obligation, to overturn any action or decision of a moderator if Reddit believes that such action or decision is not in the interest of Reddit or the Reddit community. 8. Copyright, the DMCA & Takedowns Reddit respects the intellectual property of others and requires that users of our Services do the same. We have a policy that includes the removal of any infringing materials from the Services and for the termination, in appropriate circumstances, of users of our Services who are repeat infringers. If you believe that anything on our Services infringes a copyright that you own or control, you may notify Reddit’s Designated Agent by filling out our DMCA Report Form or by contacting: Copyright Agent Reddit, Inc. 420 Taylor St. San Francisco, CA 94102 copyright@reddit.com Also, please note that if you knowingly misrepresent that any activity or material on our Service is infringing, you may be liable to Reddit for certain costs and damages. If we remove Your Content in response to a copyright or trademark notice, we will notify you via Reddit’s private messaging system. If you believe Your Content was wrongly removed due to a mistake or misidentification, you can send a counter notification to our Copyright Agent (contact information provided above). Please see 17 U.S.C. §512(g)(3) for the requirements of a proper counter notification. 9. Reddit Premium, Virtual Goods and Payment Information There are no fees for use of many aspects of the Services. However, premium features, including Reddit Premium and Virtual Goods, which include Coins, may be available for purchase on certain of our Services. In addition to these terms, by purchasing or using Reddit Premium or our Virtual Goods, you further agree to the Reddit Premium and Virtual Goods Agreement. Reddit may change the fees or benefits associated with the premium features from time to time with reasonable advance notice; provided, however, that no advance notice will be required for temporary promotions, including temporary reductions in the fees associated with the premium features. You may submit your debit card, credit card, or other payment information ("Payment Information") via our Services to purchase premium features or other paid products or services.

By continuing to access or use the Services on or after the Effective Date of the revised Terms, you agree to be bound by the revised Terms. If you do not agree to the revised Terms, you must stop accessing and using our Services before the changes become effective. 15. Additional Terms Because we offer a variety of Services, you may be asked to agree to additional terms before using a specific product or service offered by Reddit (“Additional Terms”).

This tag can be applied to individual pieces of content or to entire communities. Enforcement We have a variety of ways of enforcing our rules, including, but not limited to Asking you nicely to knock it off Asking you less nicely Temporary or permanent suspension of accounts Removal of privileges from, or adding restrictions to, accounts Adding restrictions to Reddit communities, such as adding NSFW tags or Quarantining Removal of content Banning of Reddit communities Moderation within communities Individual communities on Reddit may have their own rules in addition to ours and their own moderators to enforce them.

Last Revised January 10, 2020 We want you to understand how and why Reddit, Inc. (“Reddit,” “we” or “us”) collects, uses, and shares information about you when you use our websites, mobile apps, widgets, and other online products and services (collectively, the "Services") or when you otherwise interact with us or receive a communication from us. This Privacy Policy applies to all of our Services including Reddit Gifts, which maintains a separate privacy notice that incorporates this Privacy Policy by reference. What We Collect Information You Provide to Us We collect information you provide to us directly when you use the Services. This includes: Account information. To create an account, you must provide a username and password. Your username is public, and it doesn’t have to be related to your real name. You may also provide an email address. We also store your user account preferences and settings. Content you submit. We collect the content you submit to the Services. This includes your posts and comments including saved drafts, your messages with other users (e.g., private messages, chats, and modmail), and your reports and other communications with moderators and with us. Your content may include text, links, images, gifs, and videos. Actions you take. We collect information about the actions you take when using the Services. This includes your interactions with content, like voting, saving, hiding, and reporting. It also includes your interactions with other users, such as following, friending, and blocking. We collect your interactions with communities, like your subscriptions or moderator status. Transactional information. If you purchase products or services from us (e.g., Reddit Gold or Reddit Ads) or sign up as a potential advertiser on Reddit Ads, we will collect certain information from you, including your name, address, email address, and information about the product or service you are purchasing. Payments are processed by third-party payment processors (e.g., Stripe and PayPal), so please refer to the applicable processor’s terms and privacy policy for more information about how payment information is processed and stored. Other information. You may choose to provide other information directly to us. For example, we may collect information when you fill out a form, participate in Reddit-sponsored activities or promotions, apply for a job, request customer support or otherwise communicate with us. Information We Collect Automatically When you access or use our Services, we may also automatically collect information about you. This includes: Log and usage data. We may log information when you access and use the Services. This may include your IP address, user-agent string, browser type, operating system, referral URLs, device information (e.g., device IDs), pages visited, links clicked, the requested URL, hardware settings, and search terms. Except for the IP address used to create your account, Reddit will delete any IP addresses collected after 100 days. Information collected from cookies and similar technologies. We may receive information from cookies, which are pieces of data your browser stores and sends back to us when making requests, and similar technologies. We use this information to improve your experience, understand user activity, personalize content and advertisements, and improve the quality of our Services. For example, we store and retrieve information about your preferred language and other settings. For more information on how you can disable cookies, please see “Your Choices” below. Location information. We may receive and process information about your location. For example, with your consent, we may collect information about the specific location of your mobile device (for example, by using GPS or Bluetooth). We may also receive location information from you when you choose to share such information on our Services, including by associating your content with a location, or we may derive your approximate location from other information about you, including your IP address. Information Collected from Other Sources We may receive information about you from other sources, including from other users and third parties, and combine that information with the other information we have about you. For example, we may receive demographic or interest information about you from third parties, including advertisers, and combine it with our own data using a common account identifier such as a hash of an email address or a mobile-device ID. You can control how we use this information to personalize the Services for you by adjusting your preferences here. Linked services. If you authorize or link other services (e.g., third-party apps or websites) to access your Reddit account, Reddit receives information about your use of that service when it uses that authorization. Linking services may also cause the other service to send us information about your account with that service. To learn how information is shared with linked services, see “How Information About You Is Shared” below. Information collected from integrations. We also may receive information about you, including log and usage data and cookie information, from third-party websites that integrate our Services, including our embeds, buttons, and advertising technology. For example, when you visit a website that uses Reddit embeds, we may receive information about the web page you visited. You can control how we use this information to personalize the Services for you by adjusting your preferences here. How We Use Information About You We use information about you to: Provide, maintain, and improve the Services; Research and develop new services; Help protect the safety of Reddit and our users, which includes blocking suspected spammers, addressing abuse, and enforcing the Reddit user agreement and our other policies; Send you technical notices, updates, security alerts, invoices and other support and administrative messages; Provide customer service; Communicate with you about products, services, offers, promotions, and events, and provide other news and information we think will be of interest to you (for information about how to opt out of these communications, see “Your Choices” below); Monitor and analyze trends, usage, and activities in connection with our Services; and Personalize the Services and provide advertisements, content and features that match user profiles or interests. (for information about how to manage the types of advertisements you experience on our Services, see “Your Choices” below) How Information About You Is Shared When you use the Services, certain information may be shared with other users and the public. For example: When you submit content (such as a post or comment or public chat) to the Services, any visitors to and users of our Services will be able to see that content, the username associated with the content, and the date and time you originally submitted the content. Reddit allows other websites to embed public Reddit content via our embed tools. Reddit also allows third parties to access public Reddit content via the Reddit API and via other similar technologies. Although some parts of the Services may be private or quarantined, they may become public (e.g., at the moderator’s option in the case of private communities) and you should take that into consideration before posting to the Services. When you send private messages, messages via modmail, or private chats, the recipients of those messages will be able to see the content of your message, your username, and the date and time the message was sent. Keep in mind that additional users may be invited to join a private chat after you send a message. Moderators may elect to have modmail forwarded to their email accounts and, as a result, any modmail received by these moderators will be subject to the terms and policies of the moderator’s email provider. When other users view your profile, they will be able to see information about your activities on the Services, such as your username, prior posts and comments, karma, trophies, moderator status, Reddit Gold status, and how long you have been a member of the Services. If you choose to make the information public, your profile may also include your voting history. We offer social sharing features that let you share content or actions you take on our Services with other media. Your use of these features enables the sharing of certain information with your friends or the public, depending on the settings you establish with the third party that provides the social sharing feature. For more information about the purpose and scope of data collection and processing in connection with social sharing features, please visit the privacy policies of the third parties that provide these social sharing features (e.g., Tumblr, Facebook, and Twitter). Please note that, even when you delete your account, the posts, comments and messages you submit through the Services may still be viewable or available on our servers. For more information, see “Your Choices” below. Otherwise, we do not share, sell, or give away your personal information to third parties unless one of the following circumstances applies: With linked services. If you link your Reddit account with a third-party service, Reddit will share the information you authorize with that third-party service. You can control this sharing as described in "Your Choices" below. With our partners. We may share information with vendors, consultants, and other service providers (but not with advertisers and ad partners) who need access to such information to carry out work for us. The partner’s use of personal data will be subject to appropriate confidentiality and security measures. To comply with the law. We may share information in response to a request for information if we believe disclosure is in accordance with, or required by, any applicable law, regulation, legal process or governmental request, including, but not limited to, meeting national security or law enforcement requirements. To the extent the law allows it, we will attempt to provide you with prior notice before disclosing your information in response to such a request. Our Transparency Report has additional information about how we respond to government requests. In an emergency. We may share information if we believe it's necessary to prevent imminent and serious bodily harm to a person. To enforce our policies and rights. We may share information if we believe your actions are inconsistent with our user agreements, rules, or other Reddit policies, or to protect the rights, property, and safety of ourselves and others. With our affiliates. We may share information between and among Reddit, and any of our parents, affiliates, subsidiaries, and other companies under common control and ownership. With your consent. We may share information about you with your consent or at your direction. Aggregated or de-identified information. We may share information about you that has been aggregated or anonymized such that it cannot reasonably be used to identify you. For example, we may show the total number of times a post has been upvoted without identifying who the visitors were. Ads and Analytics Partners We may partner with third-party advertisers, ad networks, and analytics providers to deliver advertising and content targeted to your interests and to better understand your use of the Services. These third parties may collect information sent by your computer, browser, or mobile device in response to a request for content, such as unique identifiers, your IP address, or other information about your computer or device. For example: Advertisers and Ad Networks Our ad partners and ad networks may use cookies and related technologies to collect information when ads are delivered to you on our Services, but Reddit does not link to or provide them with your actual Reddit account details. This means that Reddit does not share your individual account browsing habits with advertisers. Reddit cannot see advertisers’ cookies and advertisers will not see Reddit cookies. Analytics Partners We use analytics partners (such as Google Analytics) to help analyze usage and traffic for our Services. As an example, we may use analytics partners to analyze and measure, in the aggregate, the number of unique visitors to our Services. Your Choices As a Reddit user, you have choices about how to protect and limit the collection, use, and disclosure of information about you. Accessing and Changing Your Information You can access and change certain information through the Services. See our Help Center page for more information. You can also request a copy of the personal information Reddit maintains about you by following the process described here. Deleting Your Account You may delete your account information at any time from the user preferences page. You can also submit a request to delete the personal information Reddit maintains about you by following the process described in the “Other Information - Data Subject and Consumer Information Requests” section below. When you delete your account, your profile is no longer visible to other users and disassociated from content you posted under that account. Please note, however, that the posts, comments, and messages you submitted prior to deleting your account will still be visible to others unless you first delete the specific content. We may also retain certain information about you as required by law or for legitimate business purposes after you delete your account. Controlling Linked Services’ Access to Your Account You can review the services you have linked to your account and revoke access to individual services here. Controlling the Use of Cookies Most web browsers are set to accept cookies by default. If you prefer, you can usually choose to set your browser to remove or reject first- and third-party cookies. Please note that if you choose to remove or reject cookies, this could affect the availability and functionality of our Services. Controlling Advertising and Analytics Some analytics providers we partner with may provide specific opt-out mechanisms and we may provide, as needed and as available, additional tools and third-party services that allow you to better understand cookies and how you can opt-out. For example, you may manage the use and collection of certain information by Google Analytics here. We also offer you choices about receiving personalized advertisements. You can adjust how we personalize advertisements for you by visiting your ads preferences here. You may also generally opt out of receiving personalized advertisements from certain third-party advertisers and ad networks. To learn more about these advertisements or to opt out, please visit the websites of the Digital Advertising Alliance and the Network Advertising Initiative, or if you are a user in the European Economic Area, Your Online Choices. Do Not Track Most modern web browsers give you the option to send a Do Not Track signal to the websites you visit, indicating that you do not wish to be tracked. However, there is no accepted standard for how a website should respond to this signal, and we do not take any action in response to this signal. Instead, in addition to publicly available third-party tools, we offer you the choices described in this policy to manage the collection and use of information about you. Controlling Promotional Communications You may opt out of receiving some or all categories of promotional communications from us by following the instructions in those communications or by updating your email options in your account preferences here. If you opt out of promotional communications, we may still send you non-promotional communications, such as information about your account or your use of the Services. Controlling Mobile Notifications With your consent, we may send promotional and non-promotional push notifications or alerts to your mobile device. You can deactivate these messages at any time by changing the notification settings on your mobile device. Controlling Location Information If you initially consent to our collection of location information, you can subsequently stop the collection of this information at any time by changing the preferences on your mobile device. Other Information Information Security We take measures to help protect information about you from loss, theft, misuse and unauthorized access, disclosure, alteration, and destruction. For example, we use HTTPS while information is being transmitted. We also enforce technical and administrative access controls to limit which of our employees have access to non-public personal information. You can help maintain the security of your account by configuring two-factor authentication. Data Retention We store the information we collect for as long as it is necessary for the purpose(s) for which we originally collected it. We may retain certain information for legitimate business purposes or as required by law. International Data Transfers We are based in the United States and we process and store information on servers located in the United States. We may store information on servers and equipment in other countries depending on a variety of factors, including the locations of our users and service providers. By accessing or using the Services or otherwise providing information to us, you consent to the processing, transfer and storage of information in and to the U.S. and other countries, where you may not have the same rights as you do under local law. In connection with Reddit's processing of personal data received from the European Union and Switzerland, we adhere to the EU-U.S. and Swiss-U.S. Privacy Shield Program (“Privacy Shield”) and comply with its framework and principles. Please direct any inquiries or complaints regarding our compliance with the Privacy Shield principles to the point of contact listed in the “Contact Us” section below. If we do not resolve your complaint, you may submit your complaint free of charge to JAMS. Under certain conditions specified by the Privacy Shield principles, you may also be able to invoke binding arbitration to resolve your complaint. We are subject to the investigatory and enforcement powers of the Federal Trade Commission. If we share EU or Swiss data with a third-party service provider that processes the data solely on our behalf, then we will be liable for that third party’s processing of EU or Swiss data in violation of the Privacy Shield principles, unless we can prove that we are not responsible for the event giving rise to the damage. For more information about the Privacy Shield principles and to view our certification, please visit the U.S. Department of Commerce’s Privacy Shield website.

Moderator Guidelines for Healthy Communities - Reddit menu About Careers Press Advertising Partnerships Brand Blog Reddit Mobile App Reddit.com Reddit Gifts Reddit Coins Reddit Premium User Agreement Privacy Policy Content Policy Moderator Guidelines © 2020 reddit inc. All rights reserved. Management of your own Community Remember the Content Policy Management of Multiple Communities Respect the Platform Revisions Apr 17, 2017 User Agreement Privacy Policy Content Policy Broadcasting Content Policy Moderator Guidelines Transparency Report 2017 Transparency Report 2018 Guidelines for Law Enforcement Transparency Report 2019 Moderator Guidelines for Healthy Communities Effective April 17, 2017. Engage in Good Faith Healthy communities are those where participants engage in good faith, and with an assumption of good faith for their co-collaborators. It’s not appropriate to attack your own users. Communities are active, in relation to their size and purpose, and where they are not, they are open to ideas and leadership that may make them more active. Management of your own Community Moderators are important to the Reddit ecosystem. In order to have some consistency: Community Descriptions: Please describe what your community is, so that all users can find what they are looking for on the site. Clear, Concise, and Consistent Guidelines: Healthy communities have agreed upon clear, concise, and consistent guidelines for participation. These guidelines are flexible enough to allow for some deviation and are updated when needed. Secret Guidelines aren’t fair to your users—transparency is important to the platform. Stable and Active Teams of Moderators: Healthy communities have moderators who are around to answer questions of their community and engage with the admins. Association to a Brand: We love that so many of you want to talk about brands and provide a forum for discussion. Remember to always flag your community as “unofficial” and be clear in your community description that you don’t actually represent that brand. Use of Email: Please provide an email address for us to contact you. While not always needed, certain security tools may require use of email address so that we can contact you and verify who you are as a moderator of your community. Appeals: Healthy communities allow for appropriate discussion (and appeal) of moderator actions. Appeals to your actions should be taken seriously. Moderator responses to appeals by their users should be consistent, germane to the issue raised and work through education, not punishment. Remember the Content Policy You are obligated to comply with our Content Policy. Management of Multiple Communities We know management of multiple communities can be difficult, but we expect you to manage communities as isolated communities and not use a breach of one set of community rules to ban a user from another community. In addition, camping or sitting on communities for long periods of time for the sake of holding onto them is prohibited. Respect the Platform Reddit may, at its discretion, intervene to take control of a community when it believes it in the best interest of the community or the website. This should happen rarely (e.g., a top moderator abandons a thriving community), but when it does, our goal is to keep the platform alive and vibrant, as well as to ensure your community can reach people interested in that community. Finally, when the admins contact you, we ask that you respond within a reasonable amount of time. Where moderators consistently are in violation of these guidelines, Reddit may step in with actions to heal the issues - sometimes pure education of the moderator will do, but these actions could potentially include dropping you down the moderator list, removing moderator status, prevention of future moderation rights, as well as account deletion. We hope permanent actions will never become necessary.

How to set up two-factor authentication | Reddit Help Skip to main content Reddit Help Your reddit account Search Search Breadcrumb Reddit Help Using Reddit Your reddit account How to set up two-factor authentication reddit reddit How to set up two-factor authentication How to set up two-factor authentication Jul 12, 2017 Oct 18, 2019 Your reddit account Two-factor authentication adds additional security to your Reddit account by requiring a second step to sign in. It requires you to give a 6-digit verification code generated from your phone in addition to your username and password login. When two-factor authentication is enabled, you will need your password and a verification code from your phone whenever you sign in on Reddit or with a Reddit login. Even if someone else obtained your Reddit username and password, they still could not log in as you. How do I enable two-factor authentication? Log in to your Reddit account Click on preferences in the top menu and then click password/email Under ‘two-factor authentication’, select enable Follow the steps to complete the process Verify your email address Enter your password Set up your authenticator app (see ‘Get the code through an authenticator app’ below for more information) Generate and save your backup codes Get the code through an authenticator app Several mobile apps are available which allow you to generate verification codes for two-factor authentication. Typically, any app supporting Time-based One-Time Password (TOTP) protocol will work. Here are a few we suggest: Google Authenticator (Android or iPhone) Authy (Android or iPhone) To use one of these apps: While enabling, you’ll see a prompt with a QR code you will use to register your Reddit account with your authenticator app. Open your authenticator and follow the instructions given to you (you’ll usually select to “add a new account” or similar) and scan the QR code when prompted by the app. If your authenticator app is not scanning the QR code properly or failing for another reason, you can enter the security key manually. Select enter the key manually and enter this into your authenticator app. Once your app is configured, enter the security code generated by your authenticator app to complete the two-factor authentication process. You will receive an email and personal message (PM) confirming your enrollment. Generate backup codes If you lose your mobile device or cannot use your authenticator app, you can use backup codes provided by Reddit to access your account. Ten backup codes are generated. Each code can be used only one time. We recommend you print off and store your codes in a safe location. To generate backup codes: Log in to your Reddit account Click on preferences in the top menu and then click password/email Under ‘two-factor authentication’, select generate for ‘backup codes’ Follow the steps to complete the process Enter your password Access and write down your backup codes To log in with your backup codes, see more under ‘How do I log in with two-factor authentication?’ How do I log in with two-factor authentication?

Sign in from a trusted computer You may be signed into Reddit on a trusted desktop computer even though you have lost your mobile device. If you are, you can disable two-factor authentication until you can again get verification codes. See more under ‘How do I disable two-factor authentication?’ Submit a request to our Community team We recommend this only if the previous options are unavailable. This process may take us several days and does not guarantee your account can be recovered. Submit a request and fill out the information about your account. We will ask you questions about your account to verify ownership. How do I disable two-factor authentication? To disable two-factor authentication on your Reddit account: Log in to your Reddit account Click on preferences in the top menu and then click password/email Under ‘two-factor authentication’, select disable Enter your password and select disable two-factor Will my third-party applications work with two-factor authentication? Yes. Applications using OAuth will be supported. When signing in with your Reddit credentials, you will be asked to enter your 6-digit verification code. However, some applications may not be using the OAuth protocol. If you have two-factor authentication enabled, and you are unable to sign in to a third-party application, you can use the following method: While using the third-party application: In the username field, enter your Reddit username as you normally would In the password field, enter your password and your verification code in the following format: “<password>:<verification_code>”. Don’t forget the colon in the middle! Doing so should allow you access to the app. What if I switch or get a new phone? If you get a new mobile device, you’ll need to set up two-factor authentication with your new phone: Disable two-factor authentication.

Reddit powers hundreds of thousands of distinct online communities. This User Agreement and your conduct make that possible. Hello, redditors and people of the Internet! This Reddit User Agreement ("Terms") applies to your access to and use of the websites, mobile apps, widgets, and other online products and services (collectively, the "Services") provided by Reddit, Inc. ("Reddit," "we," or "us"). Remember Reddit is for fun and is intended to be a place for your entertainment, but we still need some basic rules. By accessing or using our Services, you agree to be bound by these Terms. If you do not agree to these Terms, you may not access or use our Services. Please take a look at Reddit’s Privacy Policy too—it explains how we collect, use, and share information about you when you access or use our Services. 1. Your Access to the Services Children under the age of 13 are not allowed to create an account or otherwise use the Services. Additionally, if you are in the European Economic Area, you must be over the age required by the laws of your country to create an account or otherwise use the Services, or we need to have received verifiable consent from your parent or legal guardian. In addition, certain of our Services or portions of our Services require you to be older than 13 years of age, so please read all notices and any Additional Terms carefully when you access the Services. If you are accepting these Terms on behalf of another legal entity, including a business or a government, you represent that you have full legal authority to bind such entity to these terms. 2. Your Use of the Services Reddit grants you a personal, non-transferable, non-exclusive, revocable, limited license to use and access the Services solely as permitted by these Terms.

Except as permitted through the Services or as otherwise permitted by us in writing, your license does not include the right to: license, sell, transfer, assign, distribute, host, or otherwise commercially exploit the Services or Content; modify, prepare derivative works of, disassemble, decompile, or reverse engineer any part of the Services or Content; or access the Services or Content in order to build a similar or competitive website, product, or service, except as permitted under the Reddit API Terms of Use. We reserve the right to modify, suspend, or discontinue the Services (in whole or in part) at any time, with or without notice to you. Any future release, update, or other addition to functionality of the Services will be subject to these Terms, which may be updated from time to time. You agree that we will not be liable to you or to any third party for any modification, suspension, or discontinuation of the Services or any part thereof. 3. Your Reddit Account and Account Security To use certain features of our Services, you may be required to create a Reddit account (an "Account") and provide us with a username, password, and certain other information about yourself as set forth in the Privacy Policy. You are solely responsible for the information associated with Your Account and anything that happens related to Your Account.

By submitting Your Content to the Services, you represent and warrant that you have all rights, power, and authority necessary to grant the rights to Your Content contained within these Terms.

You retain any ownership rights you have in Your Content, but you grant Reddit the following license to use that Content: When Your Content is created with or submitted to the Services, you grant us a worldwide, royalty-free, perpetual, irrevocable, non-exclusive, transferable, and sublicensable license to use, copy, modify, adapt, prepare derivative works from, distribute, perform, and display Your Content and any name, username, voice, or likeness provided in connection with Your Content in all media formats and channels now known or later developed.

Any ideas, suggestions, and feedback about Reddit or our Services that you provide to us are entirely voluntary, and you agree that Reddit may use such ideas, suggestions, and feedback without compensation or obligation to you. Although we have no obligation to screen, edit, or monitor Your Content, we may, in our sole discretion, delete or remove Your Content at any time and for any reason, including for a violation of these Terms, a violation of our Content Policy, or if you otherwise create liability for us. 5. Third-Party Content, Advertisements and Promotions The Services may contain links to third-party websites, products, or services, which may be posted by advertisers, our affiliates, our partners, or other users (“Third-Party Content”). Third-Party Content is not under our control, and we are not responsible for any of their websites, products, or services. Your use of Third-Party Content is at your own risk and you should make any investigation you feel necessary before proceeding with any transaction in connection with such Third-Party Content. The Services may also contain sponsored Third-Party Content or advertisements. The type, degree, and targeting of advertisements are subject to change, and you acknowledge and agree that we may place advertisements in connection with the display of any Content or information on the Services, including Your Content.

Things You Cannot Do When accessing or using the Services, you must respect others and their rights, including by following these Terms and the Content Policy, so that we all may continue to use and enjoy the Services. We support the responsible reporting of security vulnerabilities. To report a security issue, please send an email to security@reddit.com.

Moderators Moderating a subreddit is an unofficial, voluntary position that may be available to users of the Services. We are not responsible for actions taken by the moderators. We recognize that moderation can take some work, so we may change the features or abilities associated with moderating from time to time without prior notice.

Copyright, the DMCA & Takedowns Reddit respects the intellectual property of others and requires that users of our Services do the same. We have a policy that includes the removal of any infringing materials from the Services and for the termination, in appropriate circumstances, of users of our Services who are repeat infringers.

Reddit may change the fees or benefits associated with the premium features from time to time with reasonable advance notice; provided, however, that no advance notice will be required for temporary promotions, including temporary reductions in the fees associated with the premium features. You may submit your debit card, credit card, or other payment information ("Payment Information") via our Services to purchase premium features or other paid products or services.

All rights reserved. What We Collect How We Use Information About You How Information About You Is Shared Ads and Analytics Partners Your Choices Other Information Contact Us Revisions Jan 10, 2020 Jun 8, 2018 Dec 12, 2017 User Agreement Privacy Policy Content Policy Broadcasting Content Policy Moderator Guidelines Transparency Report 2017 Transparency Report 2018 Guidelines for Law Enforcement Transparency Report 2019 Reddit Privacy Policy Effective January 10, 2020. Last Revised January 10, 2020 We want you to understand how and why Reddit, Inc. (“Reddit,” “we” or “us”) collects, uses, and shares information about you when you use our websites, mobile apps, widgets, and other online products and services (collectively, the "Services") or when you otherwise interact with us or receive a communication from us. This Privacy Policy applies to all of our Services including Reddit Gifts, which maintains a separate privacy notice that incorporates this Privacy Policy by reference. What We Collect Information You Provide to Us We collect information you provide to us directly when you use the Services. This includes: Account information. To create an account, you must provide a username and password. Your username is public, and it doesn’t have to be related to your real name. You may also provide an email address. We also store your user account preferences and settings. Content you submit. We collect the content you submit to the Services. This includes your posts and comments including saved drafts, your messages with other users (e.g., private messages, chats, and modmail), and your reports and other communications with moderators and with us. Your content may include text, links, images, gifs, and videos. Actions you take. We collect information about the actions you take when using the Services. This includes your interactions with content, like voting, saving, hiding, and reporting. It also includes your interactions with other users, such as following, friending, and blocking. We collect your interactions with communities, like your subscriptions or moderator status. Transactional information. If you purchase products or services from us (e.g., Reddit Gold or Reddit Ads) or sign up as a potential advertiser on Reddit Ads, we will collect certain information from you, including your name, address, email address, and information about the product or service you are purchasing. Payments are processed by third-party payment processors (e.g., Stripe and PayPal), so please refer to the applicable processor’s terms and privacy policy for more information about how payment information is processed and stored. Other information. You may choose to provide other information directly to us. For example, we may collect information when you fill out a form, participate in Reddit-sponsored activities or promotions, apply for a job, request customer support or otherwise communicate with us. Information We Collect Automatically When you access or use our Services, we may also automatically collect information about you. This includes: Log and usage data. We may log information when you access and use the Services. This may include your IP address, user-agent string, browser type, operating system, referral URLs, device information (e.g., device IDs), pages visited, links clicked, the requested URL, hardware settings, and search terms. Except for the IP address used to create your account, Reddit will delete any IP addresses collected after 100 days. Information collected from cookies and similar technologies. We may receive information from cookies, which are pieces of data your browser stores and sends back to us when making requests, and similar technologies. We use this information to improve your experience, understand user activity, personalize content and advertisements, and improve the quality of our Services. For example, we store and retrieve information about your preferred language and other settings. For more information on how you can disable cookies, please see “Your Choices” below. Location information. We may receive and process information about your location. For example, with your consent, we may collect information about the specific location of your mobile device (for example, by using GPS or Bluetooth). We may also receive location information from you when you choose to share such information on our Services, including by associating your content with a location, or we may derive your approximate location from other information about you, including your IP address. Information Collected from Other Sources We may receive information about you from other sources, including from other users and third parties, and combine that information with the other information we have about you. For example, we may receive demographic or interest information about you from third parties, including advertisers, and combine it with our own data using a common account identifier such as a hash of an email address or a mobile-device ID. You can control how we use this information to personalize the Services for you by adjusting your preferences here. Linked services. If you authorize or link other services (e.g., third-party apps or websites) to access your Reddit account, Reddit receives information about your use of that service when it uses that authorization. Linking services may also cause the other service to send us information about your account with that service. To learn how information is shared with linked services, see “How Information About You Is Shared” below. Information collected from integrations. We also may receive information about you, including log and usage data and cookie information, from third-party websites that integrate our Services, including our embeds, buttons, and advertising technology. For example, when you visit a website that uses Reddit embeds, we may receive information about the web page you visited. You can control how we use this information to personalize the Services for you by adjusting your preferences here. How We Use Information About You We use information about you to: Provide, maintain, and improve the Services; Research and develop new services; Help protect the safety of Reddit and our users, which includes blocking suspected spammers, addressing abuse, and enforcing the Reddit user agreement and our other policies; Send you technical notices, updates, security alerts, invoices and other support and administrative messages; Provide customer service; Communicate with you about products, services, offers, promotions, and events, and provide other news and information we think will be of interest to you (for information about how to opt out of these communications, see “Your Choices” below); Monitor and analyze trends, usage, and activities in connection with our Services; and Personalize the Services and provide advertisements, content and features that match user profiles or interests. (for information about how to manage the types of advertisements you experience on our Services, see “Your Choices” below) How Information About You Is Shared When you use the Services, certain information may be shared with other users and the public. For example: When you submit content (such as a post or comment or public chat) to the Services, any visitors to and users of our Services will be able to see that content, the username associated with the content, and the date and time you originally submitted the content. Reddit allows other websites to embed public Reddit content via our embed tools. Reddit also allows third parties to access public Reddit content via the Reddit API and via other similar technologies. Although some parts of the Services may be private or quarantined, they may become public (e.g., at the moderator’s option in the case of private communities) and you should take that into consideration before posting to the Services. When you send private messages, messages via modmail, or private chats, the recipients of those messages will be able to see the content of your message, your username, and the date and time the message was sent. Keep in mind that additional users may be invited to join a private chat after you send a message. Moderators may elect to have modmail forwarded to their email accounts and, as a result, any modmail received by these moderators will be subject to the terms and policies of the moderator’s email provider. When other users view your profile, they will be able to see information about your activities on the Services, such as your username, prior posts and comments, karma, trophies, moderator status, Reddit Gold status, and how long you have been a member of the Services. If you choose to make the information public, your profile may also include your voting history. We offer social sharing features that let you share content or actions you take on our Services with other media. Your use of these features enables the sharing of certain information with your friends or the public, depending on the settings you establish with the third party that provides the social sharing feature. For more information about the purpose and scope of data collection and processing in connection with social sharing features, please visit the privacy policies of the third parties that provide these social sharing features (e.g., Tumblr, Facebook, and Twitter). Please note that, even when you delete your account, the posts, comments and messages you submit through the Services may still be viewable or available on our servers. For more information, see “Your Choices” below. Otherwise, we do not share, sell, or give away your personal information to third parties unless one of the following circumstances applies: With linked services. If you link your Reddit account with a third-party service, Reddit will share the information you authorize with that third-party service. You can control this sharing as described in "Your Choices" below. With our partners. We may share information with vendors, consultants, and other service providers (but not with advertisers and ad partners) who need access to such information to carry out work for us. The partner’s use of personal data will be subject to appropriate confidentiality and security measures. To comply with the law. We may share information in response to a request for information if we believe disclosure is in accordance with, or required by, any applicable law, regulation, legal process or governmental request, including, but not limited to, meeting national security or law enforcement requirements. To the extent the law allows it, we will attempt to provide you with prior notice before disclosing your information in response to such a request. Our Transparency Report has additional information about how we respond to government requests. In an emergency. We may share information if we believe it's necessary to prevent imminent and serious bodily harm to a person. To enforce our policies and rights. We may share information if we believe your actions are inconsistent with our user agreements, rules, or other Reddit policies, or to protect the rights, property, and safety of ourselves and others. With our affiliates. We may share information between and among Reddit, and any of our parents, affiliates, subsidiaries, and other companies under common control and ownership. With your consent. We may share information about you with your consent or at your direction. Aggregated or de-identified information. We may share information about you that has been aggregated or anonymized such that it cannot reasonably be used to identify you. For example, we may show the total number of times a post has been upvoted without identifying who the visitors were. Ads and Analytics Partners We may partner with third-party advertisers, ad networks, and analytics providers to deliver advertising and content targeted to your interests and to better understand your use of the Services. These third parties may collect information sent by your computer, browser, or mobile device in response to a request for content, such as unique identifiers, your IP address, or other information about your computer or device. For example: Advertisers and Ad Networks Our ad partners and ad networks may use cookies and related technologies to collect information when ads are delivered to you on our Services, but Reddit does not link to or provide them with your actual Reddit account details. This means that Reddit does not share your individual account browsing habits with advertisers. Reddit cannot see advertisers’ cookies and advertisers will not see Reddit cookies. Analytics Partners We use analytics partners (such as Google Analytics) to help analyze usage and traffic for our Services. As an example, we may use analytics partners to analyze and measure, in the aggregate, the number of unique visitors to our Services. Your Choices As a Reddit user, you have choices about how to protect and limit the collection, use, and disclosure of information about you. Accessing and Changing Your Information You can access and change certain information through the Services. See our Help Center page for more information. You can also request a copy of the personal information Reddit maintains about you by following the process described here. Deleting Your Account You may delete your account information at any time from the user preferences page. You can also submit a request to delete the personal information Reddit maintains about you by following the process described in the “Other Information - Data Subject and Consumer Information Requests” section below. When you delete your account, your profile is no longer visible to other users and disassociated from content you posted under that account. Please note, however, that the posts, comments, and messages you submitted prior to deleting your account will still be visible to others unless you first delete the specific content. We may also retain certain information about you as required by law or for legitimate business purposes after you delete your account. Controlling Linked Services’ Access to Your Account You can review the services you have linked to your account and revoke access to individual services here. Controlling the Use of Cookies Most web browsers are set to accept cookies by default. If you prefer, you can usually choose to set your browser to remove or reject first- and third-party cookies. Please note that if you choose to remove or reject cookies, this could affect the availability and functionality of our Services. Controlling Advertising and Analytics Some analytics providers we partner with may provide specific opt-out mechanisms and we may provide, as needed and as available, additional tools and third-party services that allow you to better understand cookies and how you can opt-out. For example, you may manage the use and collection of certain information by Google Analytics here. We also offer you choices about receiving personalized advertisements. You can adjust how we personalize advertisements for you by visiting your ads preferences here. You may also generally opt out of receiving personalized advertisements from certain third-party advertisers and ad networks. To learn more about these advertisements or to opt out, please visit the websites of the Digital Advertising Alliance and the Network Advertising Initiative, or if you are a user in the European Economic Area, Your Online Choices. Do Not Track Most modern web browsers give you the option to send a Do Not Track signal to the websites you visit, indicating that you do not wish to be tracked. However, there is no accepted standard for how a website should respond to this signal, and we do not take any action in response to this signal. Instead, in addition to publicly available third-party tools, we offer you the choices described in this policy to manage the collection and use of information about you. Controlling Promotional Communications You may opt out of receiving some or all categories of promotional communications from us by following the instructions in those communications or by updating your email options in your account preferences here. If you opt out of promotional communications, we may still send you non-promotional communications, such as information about your account or your use of the Services. Controlling Mobile Notifications With your consent, we may send promotional and non-promotional push notifications or alerts to your mobile device. You can deactivate these messages at any time by changing the notification settings on your mobile device. Controlling Location Information If you initially consent to our collection of location information, you can subsequently stop the collection of this information at any time by changing the preferences on your mobile device. Other Information Information Security We take measures to help protect information about you from loss, theft, misuse and unauthorized access, disclosure, alteration, and destruction. For example, we use HTTPS while information is being transmitted. We also enforce technical and administrative access controls to limit which of our employees have access to non-public personal information. You can help maintain the security of your account by configuring two-factor authentication. Data Retention We store the information we collect for as long as it is necessary for the purpose(s) for which we originally collected it. We may retain certain information for legitimate business purposes or as required by law. International Data Transfers We are based in the United States and we process and store information on servers located in the United States. We may store information on servers and equipment in other countries depending on a variety of factors, including the locations of our users and service providers. By accessing or using the Services or otherwise providing information to us, you consent to the processing, transfer and storage of information in and to the U.S. and other countries, where you may not have the same rights as you do under local law. In connection with Reddit's processing of personal data received from the European Union and Switzerland, we adhere to the EU-U.S. and Swiss-U.S. Privacy Shield Program (“Privacy Shield”) and comply with its framework and principles. Please direct any inquiries or complaints regarding our compliance with the Privacy Shield principles to the point of contact listed in the “Contact Us” section below. If we do not resolve your complaint, you may submit your complaint free of charge to JAMS. Under certain conditions specified by the Privacy Shield principles, you may also be able to invoke binding arbitration to resolve your complaint. We are subject to the investigatory and enforcement powers of the Federal Trade Commission. If we share EU or Swiss data with a third-party service provider that processes the data solely on our behalf, then we will be liable for that third party’s processing of EU or Swiss data in violation of the Privacy Shield principles, unless we can prove that we are not responsible for the event giving rise to the damage. For more information about the Privacy Shield principles and to view our certification, please visit the U.S. Department of Commerce’s Privacy Shield website. Additional Information for EEA Users Users in the European Economic Area have the right to request access to, rectification of, or erasure of their personal data; to data portability in certain circumstances; to request restriction of processing; to object to processing; and to withdraw consent for processing where they have previously provided consent. These rights can be exercised using the information provided under “Your Choices” above or as described in the “Other Information - Data Subject and Consumer Information Requests” section below. EEA users also have the right to lodge a complaint with their local supervisory authority.

Data Subject and Consumer Information Requests Requests for a copy of the information Reddit has about your account—including EU General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) data subject access requests and California Consumer Privacy Act (CCPA) consumer information requests—can be submitted following the process described here. All other data subject and consumer requests under data protection laws should be sent via email to redditdatarequests@reddit.com from the email address that you have verified with your Reddit account. Before we process a request from you about your personal information, we need to verify the request via your access to your Reddit account or to a verified email address associated with your Reddit account. You may also designate an authorized agent to exercise these rights on your behalf. Reddit does not discriminate against users for exercising their rights under data protection laws to make requests regarding their personal information. Children Children under the age of 13 are not allowed to create an account or otherwise use the Services. Additionally, if you are in the EEA, you must be over the age required by the laws of your country to create an account or otherwise use the Services, or we need to have obtained verifiable consent from your parent or legal guardian. Changes to This Policy We may change this Privacy Policy from time to time. If we do, we will let you know by revising the date at the top of the policy. If we make a change to this policy that, in our sole discretion, is material, we will provide you with additional notice (such as adding a statement to r/announcements, the front page of the Services or sending you a notification). We encourage you to review the Privacy Policy whenever you access or use our Services or otherwise interact with us to stay informed about our information practices and the ways you can help protect your privacy. By continuing to use our Services after Privacy Policy changes go into effect, you agree to be bound by the revised policy.

Turning optional but not recommended. 586k Subscribers 1.0k Online Created Jun 3, 2008 Filter by flair Megathread Activity r/skiing Rules 1. Don't be rude or a bully. This is a friendly community where we all come to share things about skiing. Being rude or bullying another person is pointless and has no place here. 2. All submissions must be related to skiing. Any post whose central topic isn't about skiing will be regarded as spam and removed. 3. No blatant self promotion posts. Self promotion posts will be heavily scrutinized. If your post is primarily about selling a product or promoting your website/social media it will be removed. This especially is up to the discretion of the mods. The adage "It's perfectly fine to be a redditor with a website, it's not okay to be a website with a reddit account" applies here. It is fine to post content you have created from off of reddit, as long you are contributing to the community and not just doing it for personal gain. 4. No posts already covered in megathreads. If your submission is about content expressly covered by a stickied discussion post, or megathread, it will be removed. Megathreads are organizational tools meant to contain topics. Always redirect your post to the megathread for your topic if it exists. 5. Helmet Discussion Please understand the importance of a good fitted helmet to protect yourself from serious injuries in dangerous sports such as skiing. We would also like to recommend that young children and developing young adults wear some sort of head protection to protect their developing minds. It's important to wear a helmet to keep your head protected. If you have any gear or helmet related discussions feel free to ask them in the megathread.

But we need one, so this is the one rule: aka "The Golden Rule,": "Play Nice," "DBAD," and "Be excellent to one another!" If you have trouble with this, no length of rules will have any greater effect. (Graffiti and sharp objects are removed at the discretion of whichever mod or user is trying to help you understand our one rule.) 2. Guidelines, requests, and suggestions: Agreement, Unity and Conformity are not our goals; Enlightened debates in Civil Environment are! Many of us are newly awakened and angry at what we see. Hopefully this is a place to channel that anger, to vent those frustrations, to laugh at the absurdities and cry at the inhumanity, and in the process find ways to expose those in positions of authority who have long since forgotten who they serve, and replace them with those who do.

We don't necessarily have to talk about product management - better to let conversation flow. If interested, DM me. Cheers, HR 8 2 comments sharesave • Posted by26 minutes ago Practical content on building new products Hi all, I’ve been a PM for ~10 years, starting at Microsoft and moving to a smaller B2B enterprise startup (now ~500 folks). I’ve worked on a bunch of different types of products, but my focus for the past 4 years has been on new products within an established company. This PM community has always been very helpful to me. I’m thinking about putting together a blog focusing on the tools, frameworks, and playbooks I’ve gathered over the last decade. Plus lots of stories of failure and learning. Here are some of the titles of posts I’ve been thinking about. I’d love to get some feedback on any of them that sound interesting to you: Series on new product development or “how to set expectations to my execs around how long things should take” 1 - New product, same customer, same sales motion 2 - New product, new customer, same sales motion 3 - New product, new customer, new sales motion New products must be 10x better or 1/10th the cost - why 1/10th the cost is often the better strategy The paradox of customer discovery - how to go slow to go fast Developing new product ideas or “how to prove to your exec that their idea won’t work” Conducting customer interviews or “how to not believe your own bullshit” Would love to get some early feedback to prioritize :) • comment sharesave • Posted by5 minutes ago [Interview] Case study on a product you've never used? read rules Hi everyone I have a case study for a company I am interviewing for and I have no background in the tool itself but tasked to do a case study and present it to the internal team. How do you guys tackle interviews like this? I can research online as much as I can but at the end of the day I wouldn't understand my customers workflow of using the product and enhancements that can be made. Case study is to improve the maintenance/upgrade process for this company. • comment sharesave • Posted by34 minutes ago Requirements • comment sharesave • Posted by1 hour ago Advice for a 'First PM' at a startup? Hi all, I just verbally agreed to join a small early-stage startup as the first PM. I've heard some folks caution against this as it may be a rough ride and risky, etc. Reasons why I joined: Significantly better base salary pay True PM work (building software product with engineers and designers - my current PM role lets me 'configure' a vendor's product and use their engineers with little to no design. Has been a hard-sell in interviews it seems). I see it as 1-2 year learning experience in lieu of an MBA (where I earn a salary instead of paying tuition!). My main goal is to use this to supplement my large company experience so that I'm more attractive for future opportunities. Any advice for me as the first PM at the company? What should I look out for? How can I maximize this experience? Thanks! • 1 comment sharesave • Posted by1 hour ago During the interview whats the best way to tackle fictional product or case study example ? • 1 comment sharesave 24 Posted by19 hours ago How do you do delivery management and build a culture of discipline? I am an "everything" PM, in that I work for a 7 person startup as the only product person. We have 2 engineers and 1 Data Scientist. We have one "End of sprint" meeting every week on Fridays where we discuss what was done and what is next. I have to confess, we are not agile in anyway, we plan our roadmap every 2 weeks or so and are never hitting our deadlines to ship. Primary reasons for this are: As with an super early stage startup, we are super scrappy and change requirements in ongoing sprints all the time (not by much, just if I discover something new from a user interview or so that I think needs to be accounted for or changed in the current "sprint") We have only 2 engineers and they get called upon for "small" tasks like editing something on the website We also currently have another product that is a potential GTM for our core product, it's an MVP so we are constantly making incremental changes to it based on the ongoing user feedback My process of communicating requirements (PRDs or whatever) are also very simplistic. We just use Trello, where I will add a checklist of Domain-driven design type statements. This is sometimes supplemented by Figma mockups and Google Docs/Sheets, but the main requirements are in Trello and I count on my engineers to check off the items as they are done with them. I feel like I am not doing a good job of managing all of this, my co-founder/CEO calls me the product gatekeeper and wants me to own the roadmap. The engineers read the requirements, we discuss them but don't check things off. As a result in today's meeting, I did not have a good way of telling the CEO when a certain feature is going to launch because the engineers were not able to tell me when their current "sprint" is going to end. Also my CEO (since he's a former engineer himself) has a habit of pushing us to be really fast that I don't think the engineers care to pay attention to and then the CEO winds up holding me accountable when they are not meeting their "deadlines", that are unrealistically set in the first place. The engineers report to the CEO and not me so I can't even push them like he can. I may not have provided all the context, but if you think it sounds sort of familiar I'd love to learn form you what practices or processes I should incorporate to build a more disciplined product org. The team looks to me to be the head of product so I need to be able to do this, but just want more perspectives. 24 14 comments sharesave About Community Welcome to r/ProductManagement 24.5k Members 56 Online Created Oct 4, 2009 Filter by flair read rules r/ProductManagement Rules 1.

What's more, the effort of each team is often done at a different time. For example, a frontend dev may build UI against mock data making assumptions about shapes and endpoints that will eventually be available. Later, a backend developer is responsible for delivering these agreed-upon items. (Note: backend is almost always the latter to arrive here...if that matters) On paper, this all works if we all agree on a "contract" upfront and that's where the pieces all meet in the middle. In reality, things change as development is done by both parties. We also don't do a great job of planning the contracts upfront. The end result of this is that integrating the two halves always takes a lot more time and frustration than we expect and everyone is unhappy. It's also worth noting that my colleagues (other PM's) seem to take responsibility for writing a lot of the technical details of these stories (including API contracts) on behalf of the developers, despite the fact that they do not have any sort of development experience. So what I see are a bunch of smart and hardworking people all experiencing a lot of frustration but getting by with talent and hard work. Both my gut and my head tell me there are better ways of doing this, but I am used to working on teams that do not function like this. Do you all have any tips on what has (or hasn't) worked well for dealing with responsibilities for different parts of the stack being spread across both teams and time? 17 14 comments sharesave About Community Welcome to r/ProductManagement 24.5k Members 56 Online Created Oct 4, 2009 Filter by flair read rules r/ProductManagement Rules 1.
