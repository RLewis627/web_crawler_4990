I'm an networking idiot, so I'm going to throw a bunch of idiot terms out there... I recently moved into my girlfriend's place and she hates visible cables everywhere. The gigabit modem we got from Comcast is in the garage, where we can (and have) activate the ethernet ports on the walls in all the bedrooms by connecting an ethernet cable from the modem to the big ol' thingy in the garage. Currently two bedrooms are have ethernet running through the wall ports. That works great! Now, I stream on twitch and never had an issue with my upload at my old place, running 1080p at 60fps with a maximum of 10,000 bitrate. Since the modem is so far from the devices where I live now, I bought an unmanaged ethernet switch so I could connect my PC and my consoles to ethernet, so I wouldn't have to rely on Wifi. My bitrate is incredibly inconsistent. However, if I use the cable I snaked around the bedroom and don't use the ethernet switch, I get a much more consistent stream. Would I benefit from using a managed ethernet switch so I can prioritize my PC for the upload speed? My consoles really only need 2mbps up and whatever the hell Down. Is that how QoS and prioritization works? Should I just run my PC with the ethernet cable and hope for the best with the Wifi on console? â€¢ comment sharesave â€¢ Crossposted byjust now Join Is he laying on the wall â€¢ Posted by9 hours ago This is Victor enjoying rare sunny day in Vancouver.
