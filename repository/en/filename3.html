I’ll stick around to answer your questions about the report (and other topics) in the comments. Hi all, It’s that time of year again when we share Reddit’s annual transparency report. We share this report each year because you have a right to know how user data is being managed by Reddit, and how it’s both shared and not shared with government and non-government parties. You’ll find information on content removed from Reddit and requests for user information. This year, we’ve expanded the report to include new data—specifically, a breakdown of content policy removals, content manipulation removals, subreddit removals, and subreddit quarantines. By the numbers Since the full report is rather long, I’ll call out a few stats below: ADMIN REMOVALS In 2019, we removed ~53M pieces of content in total, mostly for spam and content manipulation (e.g. brigading and vote cheating), exclusive of legal/copyright removals, which we track separately. For Content Policy violations, we removed 222k pieces of content, 55.9k accounts, and 21.9k subreddits (87% of which were removed for being unmoderated). Additionally, we quarantined 256 subreddits. LEGAL REMOVALS Reddit received 110 requests from government entities to remove content, of which we complied with 37.3%. In 2019 we removed about 5x more content for copyright infringement than in 2018, largely due to copyright notices for adult-entertainment and notices targeting pieces of content that had already been removed. REQUESTS FOR USER INFORMATION We received a total of 772 requests for user account information from law enforcement and government entities. 366 of these were emergency disclosure requests, mostly from US law enforcement (68% of which we complied with). 406 were non-emergency requests (73% of which we complied with); most were US subpoenas. Reddit received an additional 224 requests to temporarily preserve certain user account information ( 86% of which we complied with). Note: We carefully review each request for compliance with applicable laws and regulations. If we determine that a request is not legally valid, Reddit will challenge or reject it. (You can read more in our Privacy Policy and Guidelines for Law Enforcement.) While I have your attention... I’d like to share an update about our thinking around quarantined communities. When we expanded our quarantine policy, we created an appeals process for sanctioned communities. One of the goals was to “force subscribers to reconsider their behavior and incentivize moderators to make changes.” While the policy attempted to hold moderators more accountable for enforcing healthier rules and norms, it didn’t address the role that each member plays in the health of their community. Today, we’re making an update to address this gap: Users who consistently upvote policy-breaking content within quarantined communities will receive automated warnings, followed by further consequences like a temporary or permanent suspension. We hope this will encourage healthier behavior across these communities. If you’ve read this far In addition to this report, we share news throughout the year from teams across Reddit, and if you like posts about what we’re doing, you can stay up to date and talk to our teams in r/RedditSecurity, r/ModNews, r/redditmobile, and r/changelog. As usual, I’ll be sticking around to answer your questions in the comments. AMA. Update: I'm off for now. Thanks for questions, everyone. 21.2k 9.9k comments sharesave 21.5k •Posted by4 hours ago Join LPT: If a credit card of finance offer excludes residents of Iowa, you probably shouldn’t apply. Miscellaneous If you pay close enough attention, you might notice that a fair amount of finance offers exclude Iowa residents. This is because Iowa has some of the most robust consumer credit laws around that - among other things - put limits on interest rates and late payment penalties, AKA, helping prevent predatory loan practices. This isn’t to say that all companies who don’t do business with Iowa residents are predatory, but I don’t think I’d want to take out a loan with a company that won’t do business with consumers who have laws that protect them from being abused by creditors. https://www.doctorofcredit.com/why-are-some-credit-card-offers-not-available-to-residents-of-iowa/ https://www.legis.iowa.gov/docs/ACO/IC/LINC/Chapter.537.pdf 21.5k 823 comments sharesave 28.5k •Posted by4 hours ago 2 Join My milk will never expire!!! 28.5k 335 comments sharesave 40.4k •Posted by14 hours ago 2& 2 More Join What was the most successful prank you’ve ever pulled? 40.4k 7.3k comments sharesave 83.6k •Posted by12 hours ago 2 Harvey Weinstein Guilty: Jury Convicts Him of Rape, Criminal Sexual Act hollywoodreporter.com/thr-es...
